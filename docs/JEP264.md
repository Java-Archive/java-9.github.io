# Platform Logging API and Service - LoggerFinder
This [JEP](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/264) is flagged with **core-util.logging**.


The main thing of this JEP is providing a facade for logging. It is something like
sl4j but now as part of the JDK.

Now we have to give an answer to a few questions.

## How to define a Logger?
To define a Logger by yourself, you could implement the interface ```System.Logger ```.
With this you could implement a Debugging-Logger for you project or delegate to the Implementation you want to use
if there is nothing provided from the Logger-Framework itself.

```java
public class SysOutLogger implements System.Logger {
 
   @Override
   public String getName() {
     return SysOutLogger.class.getSimpleName();
   }
 
   @Override // this conf is useless ;-)
   public boolean isLoggable(Level level) {
     switch (level) {
       case OFF: return false; 
       case TRACE: return false;
       case DEBUG: return true;
       case INFO: return true;
       case WARNING: return false;
       case ERROR: return false;
       case ALL: return false;
       default:
         return true;
     }
   }
 
   @Override
   public void log(Level level, ResourceBundle bundle, String msg, Throwable thrown) {
     System.out.printf("SysOutLogger: %s: \"%s\" with \"%s\"%n", level, msg, thrown);
   }
 
   @Override
   public void log(Level level, ResourceBundle bundle, String format, Object... params) {
     System.out.printf("SysOutLogger: %s: \"%s\"%n", level, format(format, params));
   }
 }
```
 

## How to declare this Logger so that it could be used?
After this we have to make sure the system will use this one.
For this you have to extend the class ```System.LoggerFinder```.
Here you have to decide what will be the right Logger instance. This could be different in 
in different situations. You could use this for a more dynamic 
behavior.

```java
public class SysOutLoggerFinder extends System.LoggerFinder {

  @Override
  public System.Logger getLogger(String name, Module module) {
    return new SysOutLogger();
  }
}
```

So far, so good..  but if you will try using it..  Nothing will happen.
You have to declare this as the active LoggingFinder.
The traditional way of doing it, would be a ServiceLocator. But with Java9 you could use
the file ```module-info.java```

```java
module org.rapidpm.workshop.java09.jep264.v001.logger {
  provides `
      with org.rapidpm.workshop.java09.jep264.v001.logger.SysOutLoggerFinder;
}
```

Here you could see, that the interface ```java.lang.System.LoggerFinder```
will be connected with the implementation ```org.rapidpm.workshop.java09.jep264.v001.logger.SysOutLoggerFinder```

Now you could use it.


```java
    final System.Logger logger = System.getLogger("LoggerName");
    System.out.println(logger.getName());
    System.out.println("logger = " + logger);

    final boolean loggable = logger.isLoggable(System.Logger.Level.DEBUG);
    System.out.println("loggable = " + loggable);

    logger.log(System.Logger.Level.DEBUG, () -> "logmessage");

```

The output would be something like the follwoing.

```text
SysOutLogger
logger = org.rapidpm.workshop.java09.jep264.v001.logger.SysOutLogger@394e1a0f
loggable = true
SysOutLogger: x DEBUG: "logmessage"
```

Happy logging......
