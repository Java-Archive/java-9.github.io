# Milling Project Coin
This [JEP](http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/213) is flagged wit **tools / javac**.

This JEP is divided in five parts. This is more or less a collections of improvements
of things we got with Java7 and Java8.

### Allow @SafeVargs on private instance methods. 
The @SafeVarargs annotation can only be applied to methods which cannot be overridden, 
like static final or public final methods.
With Java9 we could do this now with private methods, too.
Even if they are (static/unstatic) final or not.

```java
  @SafeVarargs
  public static <T> void myStaticMethod(T... args) {
    // don something
  }  
  
  @SafeVarargs
  public final <T> void myUnStaticMethod(T... args) {
    // don something
  }

  @SafeVarargs
  private final <T> void myPrivateUnStaticMethod(T... args) {
    // don something
  }

  @SafeVarargs
  private  <T> void myPrivateUnFinalUnStaticMethod(T... args) {
    // don something
  }

  @SafeVarargs
  private static final <T> void myPrivateStaticMethod(T... args) {
    // don something
  }

  @SafeVarargs
  private  static <T> void myPrivateUnFinalStaticMethod(T... args) {
    // don something
  }
```

### Allow effectively-final variables to be used as resources in the try-with-resources statement.
The target here was the reduction of boilderplate code. In Java7 and Java8 you had to write the following
lines to deal with an ```AutoClosable```

```java
  public void doSomethingWithOld(ByteArrayInputStream bais) throws Exception {
    try(final ByteArrayInputStream stream = bais) {
      final byte[] readAllBytes = stream.readAllBytes();
    }
  }  
```
In Java9 you could write it without declaring a new variable. But the attribute must be final or effectively final. 
> ***Remember:***
> A variable or parameter whose value is never changed after it is initialized is effectively final.

```java

  public void doSomethingWithOld(ByteArrayInputStream bais) throws Exception {
    try(final ByteArrayInputStream stream = bais) {
      final byte[] readAllBytes = stream.readAllBytes();
    }
  }  
  
  public void doSomethingWith(ByteArrayInputStream bais) throws Exception {
    try(bais) {
      final byte[] readAllBytes = bais.readAllBytes();
    }
  }
```

### Allow diamond with anonymous classes if the argument type of the inferred type is denotable.


### Complete the removal, begun in Java SE 8, of underscore from the set of legal identifier names.

### Support for private methods in interfaces
